            <h1 class="font-h1"> Why You Should Help Them?</h1>
            <p> In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have experienced
                heavy rains and flash floods, leaving them homeless and without possessions. With homes crushed,
                objects floating away and people missing, the country is at high alert. This is not the first time
                the northeastern region (Sylhet) of Bangladesh is experiencing these floods, which have occurred
                twice already in 2022 alone. Now, they have begun again, starting in May 2022 with heavy rains
                battering the area, rivers overflowing, and excess water sweeping through the region. Since 17th
                June, the situation has dramatically worsened and affected additional districts, increasing the
                magnitude and scale of damage. Around a quarter of the country is now flooded.</p>
